# CP301_Project
The project is about finding a sustainable solution to the problem of stubble burning. Stubble burning is a common practice in agriculture, where farmers set fire to the leftover crop residue after harvest to clear the fields for the next planting season. This practice releases harmful gases and particulate matter into the air, contributing to air pollution and climate change.

The project aims to convert the stubble into paper, which is a sustainable alternative to traditional paper made from wood pulp. The process involves converting the stubble into pulp, which is then processed into paper using standard papermaking techniques.

The project's GitHub page will provide a detailed overview of the project, including the materials and methods used to convert the stubble into paper. The results of the experiment will also be presented, along with a discussion of the potential environmental benefits of implementing this approach on a larger scale.
